    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Coconut Curry Chickpeas are a flavorful and filling easy weeknight dinner packed with chickpeas, kale, and a flavorful creamy curry sauce!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Aromatics</li>
        <li>Spices</li>
        <li>Tomato sauce</li>
        <li>Coconut milk</li>
        <li>Chickpeas</li>
        <li>Kale</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Dice the onion, mince the garlic, and grate the ginger. Add the onion, garlic, and ginger to a large deep skillet along with the olive oil. Sauté the aromatics over medium-low heat for about five minutes, or until the onions are soft and translucent.</li>
        <li>Add the curry powder and cumin to the skillet and continue to stir and cook for about one minute more to toast the spices.</li>
        <li>Drain the chickpeas, then add them to the skillet along with the tomato sauce and coconut milk. Stir everything to combine.</li>
        <li>Turn the heat up to medium-high to bring the sauce up to a simmer. Once simmering, turn the heat back down to medium-low and allow the curry to continue to simmer for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Add the kale and stir it into the sauce. Continue to cook and stir until the kale has wilted to your desired tenderness (I cook for about 5 minutes more). Finally, taste the curry and add salt to taste (about ½ tsp).</li>
    </ol>
