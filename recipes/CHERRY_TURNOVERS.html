    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Cherry Turnovers are a popular baked dessert made of flaky puff pastry dough filled with sweet and tart Cherry Sauce. Though they’re a fantastic end-of-dinner delight, they can also be enjoyed for breakfast.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Cherry Filling</li>
        <li>Puff Pastry Sheets</li>
        <li>Egg</li>
        <li>Powdered Sugar</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cover a baking sheet with parchment paper, preheat the oven to 400°F with an oven rack in the center, and gently roll thawed puff pastry sheets into 12-inch squares, then cut and arrange them on the baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Add 1/4 cup of cherry pie filling to the center-left of each square, leaving a 1-inch border around the edges to avoid overfilling and difficulty in sealing the turnovers.</li>
        <li>Fold the bottom right corner of the dough over the filling and press it into the top left corner to create a triangle.</li>
        <li>Apply a thin layer of beaten egg on each puff pastry turnover, bake at 400°F for 10 minutes, rotate the pan, and bake for an extra 10 to 15 minutes until the pastry is golden brown and risen.</li>
        <li>After cooling the pastries, create a thick glaze by mixing 1 tablespoon of milk with 1/2 cup of powdered sugar, then drizzle it over the turnovers using a fork for defined lines or a spoon for globs.</li>
    </ol>
