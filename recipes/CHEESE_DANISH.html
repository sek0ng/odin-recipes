    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Cheese Danish is a classic Danish breakfast treat made with a flaky puff pastry dough and a lightly flavored cream cheese filling.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Puff Pastry</li>
        <li>Cream Cheese</li>
        <li>Powdered Sugar</li>
        <li>Vanilla</li>
        <li>Egg</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Thaw the puff pastry in the fridge for an hour or two, or it will crack when you try to cut it. Don’t thaw it at room temperature, as the butter will melt into the dough, and you won’t get the flaky finish puff pastry is known for.</li>
        <li>Add a teaspoon of lemon or orange zest to the filling to boost flavor.</li>
        <li>Use an oven thermometer to ensure the oven is at the correct temperature.</li>
        <li>Rotate the baking sheet, front to back, halfway through cooking to ensure even baking.</li>
        <li>Mix a tablespoon of melted butter into the icing to add flavor and an even more velvety finish.</li>
        <li>Cool the Cheese Danish before adding the icing so it doesn’t melt into the pastry. To get lines of icing instead of pools of icing, use a fork, not a spoon, to drizzle the icing.</li>
    </ol>
